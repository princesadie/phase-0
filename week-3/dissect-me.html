      <h1>How I Learned to Git</h1>
      <h2>December 6, 2015</h2>
      <p>
        So this is week 1 of Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0 and I've learned several things I didn't know before. I've learned how to actually use my command line. Prior to this I simply copied and pasted from the web whenever the need arose and just put faith in the commands people were giving me. Now I can actually, albeit not master level, understand what such commands do - somewhat. One of things I got most excited to say I know how to use now is git and GitHub.
