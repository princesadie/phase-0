#1.1 Think About TIme Reflection
The benefits of habitual meditation is the single most valuable piece of information I gained from this exercise. Learning about "flow" and how to subsequently enhance your chances for achieving the state, the pomodoro technique, and Fogg's method for habit forming are all great information, but I've always discounted meditation because of my environment - no one I know gives the idea any merit. The difference now is that if an institution like Dev Bootcamp truly believes in it, then I'll give it a go. Time Boxing is the idea of setting a set period of time in which work is to be worked on and evaluating what was accomplished at the end. In the past I haven't exactly had a rigid time management agenda. I simply did as I felt and attempted to finish, which I most often did, before the deadline. More recently, I've put into practice the pomodoro technique. I'm a huge fan of the pomodoro technique because I like the idea of piecing out the day in set increments rather than full-throttling all day only to quickly burn out. I absolutely plan on continuing to use the pomodoro technique. I'll also try to get started with meditation with the help of the app Headspace. Overall, I suspect that once I get settled into the system I'll be able to do just fine in Phase 0. Adjustment will inevitably be made as I encounter issues I don't see now.

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection
1.) The shell is the user interface used to interact with and access a computer's operating system. Bash is name of the UNIX shell used in OS X.

2.) It didn't feel like any particular part of the exercise was difficult, it was more the amount to get through in one sitting. The crash course was definitely greatly paced for beginners like me. The hardest part is remembering what each particular command does and using them effectively in succession to do whatever needed to be done. I found myself often going back to read the index cards I wrote to reinforce my memory. Awesome because I've been using this method of memorization since middle-school.

3.) I did successfully use all of the commands, although not without minor issues. A few times when using rmdir it would throw me an error stating that the directory was not empty even though it surely was. I used the ls command throughout the directory and the directories that followed to make sure it was clean. I even went through Finder to double check. I eventually just used the rm -rf command to force delete everything in the directories that needed to be deleted.

4.) Besides the man and help, I think the most important commands are the navigation commands. Being able to move through the directories with cd, pushd, and popd is vital for a beginner. Not having to type long-winded paths for commands is nice for a beginner prone to typos.

5.) Command List

pwd - Prints the current directory, print working directory.
ls - Lists all files in current directory.
mv - Renames file "mv [file name] [new file name]".
cd - Change current directory
../ - Climb back up directory
touch - Creates a file
mkdir - Creates a directory
less - Displays file contents in a paged manner
rmdir - Deletes directory
rm - Deletes file
help - Provides list of commands

#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
The instructions on this challenged were pretty good and simple enough to follow. My instructions for a new person on how to do the following are going to be very similar.

How to create a new repo.

Log onto GitHub and navigate to your profile
On the upper right-hand side of the navbar is a "+", click it and choose "New Repository".
Name your repository and add a description if you'd like.
Choose whether or not this a public or private repository.
Add a license if necessary.
Hit "Create Repository"
Profit.
How to fork a repo.

Navigate to the repo you'd like to fork.
On the upper right-hand part of the site under your profile photo is the "Fork" button, hit it.
Choose where to fork this repo, probably to yourself.
Profit.
How to clone a repo. I assume this is to be done on the command line.

Navigate to the repo to be cloned.
Locate the HTTPS link and copy.
Open up Terminal.
Navigate to the directory where you're repo will live.
Type "git clone [PASTE HTTPS LINK HERE]" without the square brackets.
Profit.
Forking a repo gives you access to all the code and files in the repo. If you aren't a contributor then you likely don't have write access to the files and can't make changes. Forking gives you your own version to work on and doesn't affect the master project. I assume people fork repos rather than create new ones to gain access to the project rather than start from scratch.

 

Setting up git and GitHub were actually a lot less troublesome than I initially thought they would be. The instructions were clear and simple. I learned how to create repos, fork repos, and clone repos. Rather than struggling with the set up, I believe getting used to actually using git and GitHub will be the bigger challenge.
