#1.1 Think About TIme Reflection
The benefits of habitual meditation is the single most valuable piece of information I gained from this exercise. Learning about "flow" and how to subsequently enhance your chances for achieving the state, the pomodoro technique, and Fogg's method for habit forming are all great information, but I've always discounted meditation because of my environment - no one I know gives the idea any merit. The difference now is that if an institution like Dev Bootcamp truly believes in it, then I'll give it a go. Time Boxing is the idea of setting a set period of time in which work is to be worked on and evaluating what was accomplished at the end. In the past I haven't exactly had a rigid time management agenda. I simply did as I felt and attempted to finish, which I most often did, before the deadline. More recently, I've put into practice the pomodoro technique. I'm a huge fan of the pomodoro technique because I like the idea of piecing out the day in set increments rather than full-throttling all day only to quickly burn out. I absolutely plan on continuing to use the pomodoro technique. I'll also try to get started with meditation with the help of the app Headspace. Overall, I suspect that once I get settled into the system I'll be able to do just fine in Phase 0. Adjustment will inevitably be made as I encounter issues I don't see now.

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection
1.) The shell is the user interface used to interact with and access a computer's operating system. Bash is name of the UNIX shell used in OS X.

2.) It didn't feel like any particular part of the exercise was difficult, it was more the amount to get through in one sitting. The crash course was definitely greatly paced for beginners like me. The hardest part is remembering what each particular command does and using them effectively in succession to do whatever needed to be done. I found myself often going back to read the index cards I wrote to reinforce my memory. Awesome because I've been using this method of memorization since middle-school.

3.) I did successfully use all of the commands, although not without minor issues. A few times when using rmdir it would throw me an error stating that the directory was not empty even though it surely was. I used the ls command throughout the directory and the directories that followed to make sure it was clean. I even went through Finder to double check. I eventually just used the rm -rf command to force delete everything in the directories that needed to be deleted.

4.) Besides the man and help, I think the most important commands are the navigation commands. Being able to move through the directories with cd, pushd, and popd is vital for a beginner. Not having to type long-winded paths for commands is nice for a beginner prone to typos.

5.) Command List

pwd - Prints the current directory, print working directory.
ls - Lists all files in current directory.
mv - Renames file "mv [file name] [new file name]".
cd - Change current directory

touch - Creates a file
mkdir - Creates a directory
less - Displays file contents in a paged manner
rmdir - Deletes directory
rm - Deletes file
help - Provides list of commands
