#How to create a repository on GitHub
1.) Log into your GitHub account.
2.) On the upper right hand corner of your screen next to your profile picture is a "+" symbol. Click the "+" symbol.
3.) On the dropdown click "New Repository".
4.) Name your repository.
5.) Choose whether or not the repo should be private.
6.) Tick the "intilize this repository with a README" box.
7.) Choose a license that applies to you.
8.) Click "Create Repository".
9.) Give yourself a pat on the back, you've just created a repository on GitHub.
10.) Copy the HTTPS link your new repo.
11.) Now open your Terminal and navigate to the directory in which you'd like to keep the files.
12.) Type "git clone [HTTPS LINK GOES HERE]" without the square brackets.
13.) Tada! You created a repo and cloned it to your local machine.

Open source means that the source code to a program is freely available to the public. Anyone can take the code and use it or modify it as they wish.

Simply put, I think open source is great. It allows for communities of developers to grow around a project and for many brains to hack away at a problem. I'm not yet experienced enough to have a very strong opinion on the matter, but as of right now I think open source is generally good thing.

Providing the appropriate licenses lets people know the standing of your property. Without proper licensing people won't know whether or not your property is available to be freely used or not.

More practice with git commands is definitely helpful. I had to play around with swtiching branches and pushing the right branch out because I ran into an issue where I pushed my master branch and couldn't merge it on GitHub.

I googled a bit of git commands to see briefly what kind of documentations popped up. The top few links were pretty on par with the information provided on Canvas.
