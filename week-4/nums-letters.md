#What does puts do?
Using puts returns nil (which is to say nothing) and prints the output onto a new line.

#What is an integer? What is a float?
In the simplest terms, an integer is any number that doesn't have a decimal and a float is any number that has a decimal.

#What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
The difference between float and integer division is that float division doesn't account for the left over fraction/decimal. In other words, a problem like 3/2 would return only 1 and not 1.5. An example of this in the real world would be like if someone wanted to know how many $2 bottles of cokes they could purchase with $3. The store generally wouldn't sell them 1.5 bottles of coke.
