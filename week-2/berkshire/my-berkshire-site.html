<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It felt pretty awesome as expected. It's always a nice feeling to see the things you've worked on live. 
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  I feel like I've still got some more reading to do to completely understand HTML5 semantic elements. I understand the basics of <section>, <article>, and <nav>, but I definitely need more hands-on practice with it before it "clicks". I get that you use these specific elements when you want to add more meaning to your content and use div if the sole purpose is for styling or if the content doesn't necessarily relate to one another.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)?
  I put no styling or much formatting so I think I followed best practices pretty well. Although I'm not sure if it's considered formatting, but I did divvy up my HTML page in such a way that it looks nice to my eyes.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  I the main shortcoming of HTML is that it's very plain without the addition of other tools like CSS and javascript.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  The main thing that I've always had an issue remember when writing HTML is differentiating between classes and IDs and their respective symbols. I remember the difference by noting that classes are denoted by a period symbol. For someone recently out of school, it's easy to remember classes and periods go together.
