This is a one-to-one relationship because a home, generally, has one group of residents that reside in it.

#REFLECTION
###What is a one-to-one database?
A one-to-one database is a database in which a row of a table is linked to one and only one other in another table.

###When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
When two sets of information held by the database can only ever relate in one way. Like when a car can only have one driver and a person can only drive one car (for now) or a toilet can only be used by one person (in general) and a person can only use one toilet (usually).

###What is a many-to-many database?
A many-to-many database is one in which multiple rows of a given table can be linked to one or more row of another table.

###When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
From what I've read this is the most common type of database used. I think this is because most tables typically have one or more ways they can be related or linked to other tables.

###What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
This is my first actually going into any depth about databases and so pretty much every concept is a bit rough. It's not so much confusing as it hasn't sunk in yet.
